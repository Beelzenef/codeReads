# Contribution

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Guidelines

This is an open and collaborative project, and any suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

If you're making a pull request, please ensure it adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Check if the link is working and pointing to the right location.
2. Check your spelling and grammar.
3. Choose the corresponding section.
4. New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization, are welcome.
5. Use the following format for the commit message: `Add (website) at (category)`.
6. Keep descriptions short, sweet and to the point.
7. Use the following format: `[Name](link)`
8. Any new entry should have meaningful content at the time of the addition to this list
    â€” we can't tell whether something is awesome if there is little to see.
    As a rule of thumb, there should be at least about six months worth of content.
